1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
First, let's understand the data you already have:

Examine the time series structure (missing values, outliers)
Analyze seasonality patterns (daily, weekly, annual)
Look for trends and recurring patterns
Visualize autocorrelation to understand temporal dependencies

2. Feature Engineering
Rather than just collecting more data initially, focus on extracting useful features:

Calendar features (hour, day of week, month, holidays)
Lagged variables (previous day, previous week)
Rolling statistics (moving averages, standard deviations)
Cyclical encodings of time variables

3. External Data Collection
Now consider what additional data might improve predictions:

Weather data (temperature, humidity, etc.)
Economic indicators
Special events data
COVID-19 impact periods
Demographic changes

4. Model Development Strategy
I'd recommend a staged approach:

Baseline models (ARIMA, ETS, simple regression)
Advanced models (Prophet, LSTM, XGBoost)
Ensemble methods combining multiple approaches

5. Evaluation Framework

Use appropriate metrics (RMSE, MAPE, etc.)
Establish proper validation strategy (walk-forward validation)
Compare to simple baseline models
Test on multiple forecast horizons (next day, next week, next month)

6. Deployment Planning

Determine update frequency
Establish retraining schedule
Design monitoring system for model drift
